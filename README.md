My start to programming began when I was in 5th grade in November of 2014, when I created an account on a website called
Scratch. This website has a really simple drag-and-drop programming language that I used as an alternative to making
powerpoints for school projects, as well as a few games. Around 2017 or 2018, I got interested in JavaScript,
specifically Node.js. From there, I learned Java, which I used for a long time, and branched into a bunch of different
topics. The transition to C# was very easy since I was already familiar with Java, and that also helped with learning
C++.
This repo is a directory of all of my projects that I could find and I think are worth adding, and a really short
description of what each of them does + the tools used.
Most of these repositories are private, and I have a couple hundred more that aren't on GitHub that I haven't gone
through yet.
