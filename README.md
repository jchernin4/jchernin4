# Hi!

My name is Jeremy Chernin, I'm a student at The Pennsylvania State University pursing a bachelor's in Computer Science.

I began programming back in November of 2014, when I created an account on a website called
Scratch in the 5th grade. Although this was a relatively simple way of coding, it sparked my interest and caused me to branch out into learning JavaScript,
specifically Node.js. From there, I learned Java, which I used for a long time, and used to explore a bunch of different
topics. The transition to C# was very easy since I was already familiar with Java, and that also helped with learning
C++, which I learned shortly after.

Some of the tools I've used:

- Languages: Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP

- Packages/Tools
    - Javalin - Java HTTP server
    - MongoDB and MySQL - Database
    - React - Component-based website building tool for JavaScript/HTML/CSS
    - Discord JDA - Java Discord API wrapper
    - Nginx and Apache - HTTP and reverse proxy server
    - Gradle - Java build tool
    - JavaFX/Swing JFrames - Java GUI
    - WPF - C# GUI
    - Selenium - Browser automation
    - FabricMC, Bukkit, and Forge - Minecraft mod development toolchain
    - Unity - Game engine
    - Blender - 3D modelling/animation
    - JetBrains IDEs (Rider, Intellij, CLion, WebStorm)
    - Visual Studio IDEs (VSCode, Visual Studio)
    - NeoVim - Text editor
    - Git/GitHub - Version control
- Larger Concepts
    - APIs (creating my own and implementing others')
    - Networking
        - TCP/UDP protocols
        - HTTP protocol
        - Proxying
        - IRC
        - Routing over Tor network
    - Cybersecurity
    - Cryptocurrency
    - Databases
    - Game programming/hacking
    - OCR (image-to-text processing)
